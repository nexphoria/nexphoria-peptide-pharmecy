        body: `Many research peptides require a period of initial saturation before steady-state plasma and receptor levels are achieved. A loading phase delivers higher doses or more frequent administrations during the first 1–2 weeks to accelerate tissue distribution and receptor occupancy — particularly relevant for peptides with slow peripheral compartment equilibration (e.g., BPC-157, TB-500) or those requiring upregulation of downstream signaling machinery (e.g., GH axis peptides building IGF-1 reservoir).

Loading phases are not universally necessary. For compounds with short half-lives and fast equilibration (e.g., ipamorelin, most GLP-1 analogs administered to steady state), initiating at the maintenance dose is scientifically appropriate.`,
      },
      {
        heading: "Typical Loading Structure",
        body: `A standard loading phase runs 5–14 days at 1.5–2× the maintenance dose or increased frequency (e.g., twice-daily instead of once-daily). The maintenance phase then drops to the target dose for the duration of the research cycle.

Example — BPC-157 research protocol:
• Loading (Weeks 1–2): 300 mcg twice daily
• Maintenance (Weeks 3–12): 250 mcg once daily

Example — CJC-1295 No DAC + Ipamorelin combination:
• Loading phase is generally not used. Begin at maintenance dose. Pulsatile GH release is the primary endpoint, not receptor upregulation.`,

        body: `Growth hormone secretagogues (GHRH analogs, GHRPs, ghrelin mimetics) must be administered in alignment with the endogenous GH pulse rhythm to achieve maximal effect. Endogenous GH pulsatility follows a circadian pattern with the largest pulse occurring 1–2 hours after sleep onset, driven by decreased somatostatin tone during deep sleep.

Protocol guidance for GH axis peptides:
• Pre-sleep (60 min before bed): Optimal for maximizing natural GH pulse amplitude. Sermorelin, CJC-1295 No DAC, and ipamorelin all produce the strongest IGF-1 response in pre-sleep protocols (Vittone 1997; Sigalos 2018 meta-analysis).
• Post-exercise: A secondary optimal window. Exercise transiently reduces somatostatin tone. Administration within 30 minutes post-training captures elevated GHRH receptor sensitivity.
• Fasted morning: Acceptable for studies targeting daytime GH monitoring. Somatostatin tone is lower in the early morning than midday.
• Avoid midday/post-meal: Postprandial insulin elevation and elevated somatostatin tone significantly blunt GH response. Administering GH secretagogues within 90 minutes of a high-carbohydrate meal reduces response by 40–60% in murine models.`,

Weekly administration on a consistent day is standard for the DIO rodent models and human Phase 2/3 protocols.

A 6-zone rotation schema completes a full cycle before returning to the starting site, providing 6+ days of recovery per site — sufficient to prevent lipohypertrophic changes in most protocols.

For subcutaneous dosing in rodents, rotate between dorsal neck scruff (primary), interscapular, and lumbar-dorsal sites. Avoid consecutive injections within 1 cm of a prior site.`,

12 weeks provides:
• 3 complete monthly biological rhythms (menstrual cycle data in female cohorts, cortisol circadian entrainment)
• Sufficient duration to separate transient acute effects from sustained remodeling responses
• Adequate time for blood biomarker stabilization (IGF-1 reaches new steady state within 4–6 weeks for GH axis peptides; 8–12 weeks for body composition endpoints)

• MK-677 long-term safety: 2-year protocol with 6-month interim analyses (Nass 2008)

• 10 half-lives: ~99.9% clearance — use when co-administration study crossover design requires complete prior-compound elimination

Examples:
• Ipamorelin (half-life 2 h): 5×2h = 10 hours minimum washout
• Semaglutide (half-life ~7 days): 5×7d = 35 days; 7×7d = 49 days for receptor baseline

• IGF-1 returns to baseline within 4–6 weeks after stopping GHRH analog protocols, regardless of compound half-life
• Body composition changes from GLP-1 agonists persist for months post-washout (weight regain trajectory studies are themselves valid research designs)
• Collagen remodeling initiated by BPC-157 or TB-500 may continue for weeks post-compound clearance due to fibroblast/TGF-β signaling cascade self-perpetuation
• Telomere length changes from Epitalon are a permanent endpoint — "washout" is not a relevant concept

Design your washout requirements based on the specific biomarker you intend to measure, not just plasma PK clearance.`,

Standard cycle structure for GHRP-containing protocols:
• On-cycle: 8–12 weeks
• Off/reduced interval: 4–6 weeks (or switch to GHRH-only during off weeks)

Additive stacks produce roughly the sum of individual effects — relevant for repair compounds (BPC-157 + TB-500 acting on complementary tissue repair pathways) and antioxidant/longevity compounds (NAD+ + GHK-Cu + Epitalon targeting different aging mechanisms without receptor overlap).

Identify whether your stack rationale is synergistic or additive before designing administration timing, since synergistic stacks often require co-timing within a narrow window (e.g., GHRP + GHRH within 5–10 minutes for maximum GH amplitude), while additive stacks do not.`,

• Use combination timing where half-life allows: GH axis protocols allow CJC-1295 DAC to be administered weekly while ipamorelin is administered daily — reducing daily injection count without sacrificing protocol design
