  {
    q: "What temperature do you ship at?",
    a: "Lyophilized peptides are stable at room temperature for short periods, but we ship with cold packs as a precaution. Our target internal box temperature is 2–8°C for gel-ice shipments and ≤ −20°C surface contact for dry-ice overnight orders. This ensures maximum stability regardless of ambient conditions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you ship internationally?",
    a: "Currently we ship within the contiguous United States only. We do not ship internationally, to Alaska, Hawaii, or US territories at this time. All orders require a valid US shipping address for a licensed research institution or verified professional address.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does order processing take?",
    a: "Orders placed before 12:00 PM ET on business days (Monday–Friday, excluding US federal holidays) typically ship same day. Orders placed after 12:00 PM ET ship the next business day. We do not ship on weekends or federal holidays.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I track my order?",
    a: "Yes. Tracking information is emailed to the address on file as soon as the carrier scans your label. You can also look up your order at nexphoria.com/account/orders using your email address and Stripe session ID.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if my order arrives warm or damaged?",
    a: "Document the condition immediately with photos. Email support at hello@nexphoria.com within 24 hours of delivery with your order number and images. We will assess and, if the cold-chain integrity was clearly compromised in transit, issue a replacement at no charge. We do not offer refunds on compounds — only replacements for verified transit damage.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you require a signature on delivery?",
    a: "Priority Overnight orders require an adult signature by default to ensure compounds are received promptly. If no one is available, the carrier will leave a pickup notice. We strongly recommend shipping to an address where someone will be present during delivery hours.",
  },
  {
    q: "How should I store compounds immediately on arrival?",
    a: "Transfer lyophilized vials to −20°C freezer storage as soon as possible after arrival. Do not leave compounds in a warm car or office for extended periods. Reconstituted vials should be refrigerated at 2–8°C and used within the stability window noted on the product page.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is your return policy?",
    a: "We do not accept returns on research compounds. All sales are final. We will replace orders confirmed lost in transit (after carrier investigation) or orders with verified cold-chain compromise. If you received the wrong compound, contact us within 48 hours with lot documentation.",

                Why Cold-Chain Matters
              </h3>
              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#5A4A10" }}>
                Peptide bonds are susceptible to hydrolysis and oxidation at
                elevated temperatures. A single 24-hour exposure above 25°C can
                reduce purity by 1–3% in sensitive compounds. Our cold-chain
                protocol ensures the compound you receive matches the purity
                on your COA — not something lower due to a warm truck or
                postal delay.
