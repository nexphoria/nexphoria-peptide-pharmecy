Temperature is one of the least visible — and most consequential — variables in peptide quality, and it is one that many researchers fail to scrutinize when evaluating suppliers.",

      text: "Peptide bonds (amide bonds) are susceptible to hydrolysis — breaking the bond between adjacent amino acids. This process is slow at low temperatures and accelerates significantly above 25°C, particularly for peptides dissolved in aqueous solution. In lyophilized (freeze-dried) form, hydrolysis risk is low because the absence of water limits the reaction. However, trace residual moisture in a poorly lyophilized preparation can still support hydrolysis over time. In reconstituted form, hydrolysis proceeds at a measurable rate even at 4°C; at room temperature, reconstituted peptides typically degrade within days to weeks depending on sequence.",

Oxidation is accelerated by elevated temperature, exposure to light (particularly UV), and dissolved oxygen in the solution. Peptides containing these residues — including TB-500 (methionine at position 6), BPC-157, and semaglutide — require particularly attentive cold storage.",
